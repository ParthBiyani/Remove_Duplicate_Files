# Remove_Duplicate_Files

The .bat file was created so as to be able to delete only those files from the target folder (and all the subfolders) that contained a contained a certain string in the filename.
This was specifically done to cater to a problem that arised on my hard drive while I mistakenly took backup of already existing files and told the system to keep both files. Now the new files had "(20220312_090131)" in its filename. To delete these unneccessary files, this batch file was used.
